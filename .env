This ecommerce website has a React frontend and a Node.js/Express backend. The frontend uses Redux for state management and React Router for client-side routing. The backend uses Mongoose to interact with a MongoDB database. The website has four pages: Home, Product, Cart, and Checkout. The Home page displays a list of products, the Product page displays a single product, the Cart page displays the user's cart, and the Checkout page handles the checkout process.
